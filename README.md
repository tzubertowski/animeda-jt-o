## What is this
This small userscript adds a _Download_ button to animedao content.

## Why
I travel a lot and consume content offline. If you close your browser, your laptop crashes - your download is lost.

## How to use it
* Install [the recommended userscript extension for your browser](https://www.google.com/search?q=tampermonkey&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)
* simply navigate to [the userscript from this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzubertowski/animeda-jt-o/master/animedajto.user.js) and install it
* go to any of the videos on animedao
* you should notice a download button underneath the video player for the supported providers
